# 1. What is CDF?

## Definition

The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** of a real-valued random variable $X$ is the function given by:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)
$$
F_X(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \le x)
$$
where the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on a value less than or equal to $x$.

The probability that $X$ lies in the semi-closed interval $(a, b]$, where $a < b$, is therefore:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)
$$
\mathbb{P}(a < X \le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)
$$

The CDF of a continuous random variable $X$ can be expressed as the integral of its **probability density function (PDF)** $f_X$ as follows:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)
$$
F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(t)\, dt
$$
