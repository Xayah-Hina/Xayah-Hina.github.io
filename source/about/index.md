## Xayah

I'm a first year master student at [Laboratory of Information Media Environment](https://ime.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/) at Hokkaido University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yoshinori Dobashi](https://ime.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/~doba/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree from [the School of Information Science & Technology, Beijing Forestry University](https://it.bjfu.edu.cn/).

Currently, my reserch interests center in physics-based animation, mainly in Fluid Simulation and High Performance Computing. In my spare time, I'm an amateur VOCALOID producer.
